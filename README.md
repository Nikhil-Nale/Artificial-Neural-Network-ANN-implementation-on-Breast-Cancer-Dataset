# Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-implementation-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
To implement artificial neural network, I have used Keras which is a high-level Neural Networks API built on top of low-level neural networks APIs like Tensorflow and Theano. As it is high-level, many things are already taken care of therefore it is easy to work with and a great tool to start with.
